Here's the source code for my Renpy games.



# Contribution Guide

First off, If you wanna help with coding and stuff, I suggest you get RenPy
link to that: https://www.renpy.org/latest.html

After that, clone the repository into your RenPy folder and copy the project files.

If you wanna help with sprites, please be aware that i use Paint.net. If you want me to be able to edit stuff, please use Paint.net. if not, tell me what program you use, and i'll see if i can get a plugin for Paint.net to open it.

# For sprite contributors:

Current files I can work with are as follows...
pdn, png, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, GIF, TGA, DDS, JPGXR, HEIC, AVIF, WebP
